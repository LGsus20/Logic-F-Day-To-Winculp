# Logic-F-Day-To-Winculp
Takes the values of "Logic Friday" converts them into a format that WinCULP can use.


The program will ask you how many variables do you wanna introduce, after that it will
ask you for the value n (value 1, value 2....), and when it's done it will write a 
.txt file with the correct format.
